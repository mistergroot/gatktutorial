    "Make sure to try the most up-to-date version of TWISST and Simon H. Martin's [General Genomics Tools](https://github.com/simonhmartin/genomics_general/) as they may provide performance improvements. However, at the time of creating this notebook, I was having difficulties making the most recent version of each repo run together. To solve this, I used the following [version](https://github.com/simonhmartin/twisst/tree/9d9634b9fc5e2763423daac01512b78be3244679) of TWISST and [this](https://github.com/simonhmartin/genomics_general/tree/fd66be9658b65399215e96dd8243070ce21d2b5d) version of the general genomics tools. To make the `raxml_sliding_window.py` script run, I replaced the `import` section of a newer version of the script. You can do that yourself or just replace the old version of the script in the cloned repo with this [one](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mistergroot/gatktutorial/master/scripts/raxml_sliding_windows.py).\n",

    "All these commands can be combined so theres just one long line to run in a loop but I like to do things in steps so there's a lot of intermediate files generated."
